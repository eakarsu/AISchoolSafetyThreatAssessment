# Production readiness and governed workflow

## Supported narrow workflow

The supported surface is **School safety response review** at `/api/governed-safety-responses`. It provides tenant- and subject-scoped cases, opaque evidence digests, deterministic assessments, optimistic state transitions, dual control, immutable event history, and connector-failure receipts.

Every request after authentication requires:

- `X-Tenant-Id`
- `Idempotency-Key` for mutations
- an active row in `governed_tenant_memberships`
- a subject reference within that membership's prefix

The policy endpoint reports declared connectors as unconfigured. No scanner, SIS, ticketing, notification, CAD, evidence, access-control, emergency, or hardware integration is configured or validated. The workflow cannot dispatch, isolate, lock, diagnose, or notify automatically.

## Deliberate fail-closed boundaries

- Deterministic assessment always returns `automatedDecision: false`, `requiresHumanReview: true`, and a null consequential command.
- Raw personal, financial, safety, or media content is rejected. Store it only in an approved encrypted system and submit an opaque reference, version, timestamp, and SHA-256 digest.
- Legacy generated, AI, and gap routes are unloaded and return 503 unless explicitly enabled for non-production evaluation. Production rejects that flag.
- Startup does not create, alter, seed, or migrate a database. Legacy schema bootstrap is off and prohibited in production.
- Connector failure receipts are durable and tenant scoped; they do not retry or invoke a provider.
- Membership grants, connector credentials, retention schedules, incident handling, and professional review remain deployment responsibilities.

## Reviewed deployment sequence

1. Create a secret of at least 32 random characters and set `JWT_SECRET`; set an explicit `CORS_ORIGINS` allowlist.
2. Review `server/migrations/001_governed_school_safety.sql` and apply it manually in a controlled change window:
   `psql "$DATABASE_URL" -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f server/migrations/001_governed_school_safety.sql`
3. Provision least-privilege `governed_tenant_memberships` rows through an approved administrative process. Never accept tenant or privileged role grants from public registration.
4. Install locked dependencies explicitly in `server` and `client`; review vulnerabilities and licenses.
5. Run `node --test server/governance/*.test.cjs`, syntax checks, and `bash -n start.sh`.
6. Contract-test each connector in a non-production tenant, including timeouts, duplicates, retries, stale versions, partial failures, reconciliation, revocation, and deletion.
7. Keep `ENABLE_LEGACY_PROVIDER_ROUTES=false` and `ENABLE_LEGACY_SCHEMA_BOOTSTRAP=false` in production.
8. Start with `./start.sh`. It only starts already-installed processes and uses graceful cleanup.

## Rollback and recovery

The migration is additive. Do not delete immutable case, evidence, or event history. Application rollback consists of stopping the new binary and restoring the prior application release; preserve the governed tables for audit and reconciliation. Record connector outages through `/api/governed-safety-responses/connector-failures`, correct upstream data in its authoritative system, attach a new versioned receipt, and use an allowed recovery/correction/rollback transition.

No database migration, build, provider call, external service, or end-to-end environment was executed as part of this remediation.
